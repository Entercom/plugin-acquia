description: |
  Development and staging servers may have less disk space allocated to them
  than a production server. When you are copying files from your production
  server back to staging or development, you can quickly fill up your disk
  space. It's possible to use the files on the production server for your
  staging site without copying them by using [Stage File Proxy](https://drupal.org/project/stage_file_proxy)
  module.

  Using the Stage File Proxy module enables a development server to maintain a
  clean files directory and use files from an alternate source by directly
  referencing that alternate source. An additional option within the module
  allows the file system on the development server to be seeded with files
  from the production server.

  Install and configure the [Stage File Proxy](https://drupal.org/project/stage_file_proxy)
  module into your codebase.
