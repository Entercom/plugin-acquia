# drutiny-acquia
Acquia drives and checks for Drutiny.

## Installation
Ensure your `composer.json` file looks like this:

```json
{
    "minimum-stability": "dev",
    "require-dev": {
        "drutiny/acquia": "dev-master"
    }
}
```

Then run composer install to install drutiny/acquia.

composer install
```

Alternately, you can run installation like this:

```bash
echo '{}' > composer.json
composer config minimum-stability dev
composer require --dev drutiny/acquia:dev-master
```

## Usage
Acquia checks are prefixed with `acquia`

```bash

uses an older version of Guzzle you may see warnings about the package being abandoned.
